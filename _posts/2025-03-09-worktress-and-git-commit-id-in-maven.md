# JGit, Worktrees, and an Outdated Maven Plugin: A Technical Analysis

## Background

I utilize Git worktrees - as should anyone with a sophisticated understanding of Git beyond mere main branch operations. The objective was straightforward: each worktree should maintain a corresponding Flyway database state. A fundamentally sound architectural decision.

However, we encountered an issue stemming from yet another subpar Git reimplementation. The inherent limitations of such reimplementations compared to the original Git implementation are, of course, well-documented.

The root cause, predictably, traces back to an outdated version of JGit (a Java-based Git implementation, for those unfamiliar with the ecosystem).

## Technical Analysis

The core issue lies in JGit's inability to process the `.git` file structure in worktrees. While the original Git implementation elegantly handles this as a file rather than a directory, JGit's antiquated version fails spectacularly, producing this rather unsophisticated error:

```shell
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal pl.project13.maven:git-commit-id-plugin:4.9.10:revision (get-the-git-infos) 
on project [REDACTED]: Could not complete Mojo execution...: 
Error: Could not get HEAD Ref, are you sure you have some commits in the dotGitDirectory? -> [Help 1]
```

## Failed Mitigation Attempts

Initial attempts at resolution through symlink substitution proved ineffective. Hard links for directories, being a technical impossibility, were similarly nonviable.

## The Proper Solution

The correct approach involves upgrading to the current git-commit-id implementation, now properly termed [git-commit-id-maven](https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin).

One caveat: it requires Maven 4. For teams unable to maintain current technology standards, alternative solutions become necessary.

## Temporary Workarounds

For those constrained by legacy systems:

1. **Native Git Implementation (Pom Edit)**:
   - [Reference Implementation](https://github.com/eolivelli/kop/commit/1753b6b10eac0dee7f15e156b430fbeecae8790b)

2. **Command Line Alternative (Change call on Terminal/Commandline/Shell)**:
   - [Technical Documentation](https://github.com/git-commit-id/git-commit-id-maven-plugin/issues/215)

## Conclusion

Utilizing JGit's reimplementation of Git functionality is problematic enough. Persisting with an outdated version is akin to attempting to run contemporary applications on obsolete hardware - while technically possible, it represents a fundamentally flawed approach. Professional Git worktree usage demands current tooling, not temporary workarounds.

The solution is clear: upgrade your infrastructure or live with the consequences of technical debt.
