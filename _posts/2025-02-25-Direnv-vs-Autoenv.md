tldr; Use Direnv
| Feature      | direnv | autoenv |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| **Security** | Requires explicit trust (`direnv allow`), preventing accidental execution of malicious files. | Automatically executes `.env` files, posing a security risk if a malicious file is encountered. |
| **Ease of Use** | Requires an initial setup step but provides a seamless experience afterward. | Works immediately without explicit approval, making it more convenient but riskier. |
| **Feature Set** | Supports shell scripting, inheritance, automatic unloading, and integration with shell profiles. | Works primarily with `.env` files, has limited scripting capabilities, and lacks an explicit unload mechanism. |
| **Compatibility** | Works with multiple shells (`bash`, `zsh`, `fish`, `tcsh`, `elvish`, etc.). | Works mainly with `bash` and `zsh`. |


#direnv vs. autoenv: You probably want to use direnv
If you’re starting a small project and just need something that works with minimal setup, autoenv can be a convenient choice. It will blindly execute whatever .env file is in your directory without a second thought, which is exactly what you want when you’re hacking together something quick and disposable. It’s simple, immediate, and requires no extra commands. Just don’t be surprised when you accidentally execute a shady .env file from an old repo you forgot about.

But if you’re working on a real project—something bigger, something where your application already relies on structured .env files—you need direnv. Why? Because unlike autoenv, it doesn’t just blindly execute whatever it finds. It forces you to explicitly allow each directory’s environment, preventing unexpected surprises. More importantly, direnv plays well with existing workflows: it integrates smoothly with shells, unloads variables when you leave a directory, and even supports more advanced scripting. If you care about stability, security, and not dealing with weird environment pollution, this is the tool you should be using.

The bottom line? Autoenv is fine if you don’t mind living on the edge (or just don’t care). But if you’re serious about your development workflow and do not want to deal with the headache of rogue environment variables creeping into your system, direnv is the only sane choice. Personally i think, that you don't want start 'simple' by using autoenv and later learn direnv, when direnv is the same effort to learn and apply.
