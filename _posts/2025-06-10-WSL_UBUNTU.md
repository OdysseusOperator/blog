Why Ubuntu Is the Only Real Choice for Coding in WSL (Yeah, I Said It)
Let’s not waste time pretending all Linux distributions are created equal, because they're not. If you are setting up WSL and you’re not using Ubuntu, I have to ask: why are you making life harder for yourself?

Sure, you can install Fedora, Arch, NixOS (good luck), or whatever niche distro you found on Reddit last night. But if you actually care about productivity, compatibility, and a massive ecosystem of tools and tutorials—you'll use Ubuntu. Here’s why.

1. Everyone Builds for Ubuntu First
When a tool or framework says it supports Linux, what they really mean is: "We tested it on Ubuntu. Maybe it'll work elsewhere. Good luck."

Even Microsoft’s WSL demos default to Ubuntu. Why? Because it just works.

2. Tutorials Speak Ubuntu, Not Fedora or Arch
Search for any programming tutorial—Python, Node.js, Rust, Kubernetes. They all start with:

bash:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install <thing you need>
That’s the universal language of Linux tutorials. Fedora users? Translating. Arch users? Writing their own playbook. Ubuntu users? Already moving on.

3. Package Managers and PPAs Just Work
Ubuntu’s APT ecosystem is rock-solid and stupidly convenient. Need something new? Chances are, there’s a PPA waiting for you.

bash:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:whatever/tool
sudo apt update
sudo apt install tool
That’s it. Fedora folks are still wrestling with RPMs. Arch users are enjoying their compile times. We’re done.

4. Community Support Is Everywhere
Stack Overflow? Ubuntu. GitHub issues? Ubuntu. Random blog post from 2012? Ubuntu.

If you break something, someone’s probably already broken it on Ubuntu and documented the fix. Try finding that level of help for Arch on WSL. I’ll wait.

Final Thought: Don't Overcomplicate It
You can waste time tinkering with niche distros, or you can actually get work done.

Ubuntu is the obvious choice, the clear choice, the easy choice.
